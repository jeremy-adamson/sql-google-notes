# Data-driven decisions

## Qualitative vs Quantitative

* Qualitative

  * Focus groups
  * Social media text analysis
  * In-person intervews

* Quantitative

  * Structured interviews
  * Surveys
  * Polls

## Data-inspired decision making

* Can discover what the data has in common when exploring different data sources

## Data vs Metrics

* Data is the collection
* Metric is the specific piece

## Dashboards

Dashbopards are powerful visual tools that help you tell your data story

### Benefits

* Centralization - Shareing a single source of data with all stakeholders
* Visualization - Showing and updating live, incoming data in real time
  * Spotting changing trends and patterns more quickly
* Insightfulness - Pulling relevant information from different datasets
  * Understanding the story behind the numbers to keep track of goals and make data-driven decisions
* Customization - Creating custom views dedicated to specific person, project, or presentation of the data

### Creating a dashboard

* Identify the stakeholders who need to see the data and how they will use it
* Design the dashboard in terms of what will need to be displayed
* Possibly create mock-ups if desired
* Select the visualizations you will use
* Create filters as needed so as to only show the relavent information at the time

### Types of Dashboards

* Strategic - focuses on long term goals and strategies at the highest level of metrics (longer than one quarter)
* Operational - short-term performance trackign and intermediate goals (up to one quarter)
* Analytical - consist of the datasets and the mathematics used in the sets (number breakdowns)

## Big and Small Data

### Small Data

* Describes a data set made up of specific metrics over a short, well-defined time period
* Usually organized and analyzed in spreadsheets
* Likely to be used by small and midsize businesses
* Simple to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent
* Usually already in a manageable size for analysis

### Big Data

* Describes lar, less-specific data sets that cover a long time period
* Usually kept in a database and queries
* Likely to be used by large organizations
* Takes a lot of effor tto collect, store, manage, sort, and visualy represent
* Usually needs to be broken into smaller peices in order to be organized and analyzed effectively for decision-making

It's easy to let lost in the weeds with so much information at hand

#### The big words for big data

* Volume - how much
* Variety - The different kinds
* Velocity - How fast it can be processed
* Veracity - The quality or reliability of the data
