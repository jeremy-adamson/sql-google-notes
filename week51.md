# Organizing data to begin analysis

Four phases of analysis

* Organize data - Collecting the data needed
* Format and adjust data - Rearranging the data to make it easier to work with
* Get input from others - Soliciting information from other sources to inform your decisions
* Transform data - Identifying relationships and patterns between the datasets and making calculations based on the data

## Organize data

A data analyst uses database organization to decide which data is relecant ot their analysis and which data types and variable are appropriate

Filtering and sorting are two ways things can be organized when you format and adjust data to work with it

* Sorting is when you arrange data into a meaningful order to make it easier to understand, analyze, and visualize.
* Filtering is used when you are only interested in seeing data that meets a specific criteria, and hiding the rest.

### Sorting

* Sort sheet - All of the data in a spreadsheet is sorted by the ranking of a specific sorted column - data across rows is kept together
* Sort range does NOT keep the information across rows together

Sorting in a spreadsheet

* =SORT(data, range, TRUE) - TRUE = ASC, FALSE = DESC
* Customized sort order - When you sort data in a spreadsheet using multiple conditions

Excel has [SORT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sort-function-22f63bd0-ccc8-492f-953d-c20e8e44b86c), [SORTBY](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sortby-function-cd2d7a62-1b93-435c-b561-d6a35134f28f), and [FILTER](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/filter-function-f4f7cb66-82eb-4767-8f7c-4877ad80c759) functions which can be lookedup later
