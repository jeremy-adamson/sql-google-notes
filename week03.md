What kind of data does it need?
How will it be managed throughout the life cycle?
Who will be responsible for it, and the optimal outcomes?

### Capture

Collecting data and bringing it in

### Manage

How the data is taken care of.  How it's stored, secured, and maintained.

### Analyze

Using the data to draw conclusions / solve problems.

### Archive
