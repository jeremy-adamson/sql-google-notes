# Data Exploration

## Unit 3 Syllabus

* Understanding data types and structures - how analysts decide which data to collect for analysis.  Structured and unstructured data, data types, and data formats in preparation for for data exploration

* Understanding bias, credibility, privacy, ethics, and access - Pretty self explanatory

* Databases: Where does the data live - When analyzing data, it will be stored in a database

* Organizing and protecting your data - Name says it all

* Engaging in the data community - Having a strong online presence can be a big help for job seekers and there are benefits to networkign with other data analytics progessionals.

## Selecting the right data

Have to take the following into account

* Data sources
  * First party - Data that you collect yourself
  * Second party - collected by another group and then sold
  * Third party - sold by a provider that didn't collect the data themselves
* Solving your business problem
* How much data to collect
* Timeframe

## Data formats in practice

* Primary vs. Secondary
  * Primary is collected first-hand
  * Gathered by other people
* Internal vs. External
  * Internal data lives inside a company's own systems
  * External data lives outside of a company
* Continuous or Discrete
  * Continuous data can have any numerical value
  * Discrete data has a limited number of values
* Qualititive vs. Quantitative
  * Qualitative is subjective
  * Quantitative is mostly facts and figures
* Nominal vs. Ordinal
  * Nominal is a type of qualitative data that isn't categorized with a set order (! 1 to 5 stars)
  * Ordinal has a set order (1 to 5 stars)
* Structured vs. Unstructured
  * Organized via rows and columns
  * Unstructured isn't easily organized (social media, videos, etc.)

## Three most common types of data modeling

* Conceptual - Buisness concepts.  How data interacts across an organization.
* Logical - Data entities.  Details of a database such as relationships, attributes, and entities
* Physical - Physical tables

## Data Modeling techniques

* Entity relationship diagram (ERD)
  * Visual way to understand the relationship between entities int he data model
* Unified modeling language (UML)
  * Detailed diagrams that describe the structure of a system by showing the eyetem's entities, attributes, operations, and their relationships.

## Long Data and Wide Data

* Long data just shoves everything into as few columns as possible
* Wide data includes as many columns as possible (kinda)
