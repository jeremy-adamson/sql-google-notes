# Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere

## Topics

## Dimensions of Data Analytics

### Six Steps to keep in mind

* Ask - Questions and define the problem

Pose a question, problem, or hypothesis about a situation to suggest a change

* Prepare - Data by collecting and storing the information

Planning phase to determine the data to be collected, who would have access to the data, and finally how it should be presented

* Process - Data by cleaning and chekcing the information

Upholding ethics of the situation/test/data-set.  Cleaning it properly while securing the raw data.  Collecting, staring, amaging, and protecting.

* Analyze - Data to find patterns, relationships, and trends

Discovering conclusions from the data set provided and then documenting the findings.  Finding patterns.

* Share - Data with your audience

Communicating the results and defining who the results should be communicated to.

* Act - on the data and use the analysis results

Determine how to best implement changes to take action.

## Other Notes

* Machine Learning - Making many decisions und a certain uncertainty.  Performance.

* Statistics - Making important decisions under a certain uncertainty

* Analytics - Looking at the situations as a whole? Speed in going through data

## Understanding the Data Ecosystem

An ecosystem is a group of elements that interact to produce, pamage, store, organize, analyze, and share data.

Typically stored on a cloud.

Data science is about creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data.
Data scientists create new questions but analysts find answer to the questions from the data.

Data analysis is the collection and drawing conclusion from data
Data analytics is the science of data

Data driven decision making is defined as using facts to do business
