# Why is data cleaning important

Data engineers transform data into a useful format for analysis and give it a reliable infrastructure
Data warehousing specialists develop processes and procedures to effectively store and organize data

## Dirty Data

* Duplicate data - Anything that shows up more than once
* Outdated data
* Incomplete data - Missing fields
* Incorrect/inaccurate data
* Inconsistent data - Using different formats to represent the same thing

* Validity - The concept of using data integrity principles to ensure measures conform to defined business rules or constraints
* Accuracy - The degree of conformity of a measure to a standard or true value
* Completeness - The degree to which all required measures are known
* Consistency - The degree to which a set of measures is equivalent across systems
