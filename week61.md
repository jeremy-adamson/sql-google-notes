# Visualizing data

The Graphic representation of data or information

## Communivating your data insights

Four parts to combine for visualization and presentation [here](https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/what-makes-a-good-data-visualization/)

* Information (data) - Integrity, accuracy, consistentcy, honesty
  * The data you are working with
* Story (concept) - Interestingness (really?), relevant, meaningful, new
  * A clear and compelling narrative or concept
* Goal (function) - Usefulness, useable, fitting, efficient
  * A specific objective or function for the visual
* Visual form (metaphor) - Beauty, structure, appearance, harmony

Another way of looking at this [here](https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/junk-charts-trifecta-checkup-the-definitive-guide.html):

* What is the practical question?
* What does the data say?
* What does the visual say?

Pre-attentive attributes: marks and channels:

* Marks - basic visual objects like points, lines, and shapes.
  * Position - Where a specific mark is in space in relation to a scale or to other marks
  * Size - How big, small, long, or tall a mark is
  * Shape - Whether a specific object is given a shape that communicates something about it
  * Color - I mean... color

* Channels - are visual aspects or variables that represent charactistics of the data.  Basically marks that have been used to make things look pretty.
  * Accuracy - Are the channels helpful in accurately estimating the values being represented?
  * Popout - How easy is it to distinguish certain values form other?
  * Grouping - How good is a channel at communicating groups that exist in the data?

Design principles:

* Choose the right visual
* Optimize the data-ink ratio - Minimize visuals/graphics that aren't needed
* Use orientation effectively - Make sure labels on the chars are easy to read via the orientation
* Color - Is color...
* Numbers of things - Think about how many elements you include in any visual.  If doing lines do five or fewer.  Otherwise highlight the important ones if needed.  Pie charts should be less than seven.

Avoid misleading charts

* Don't cut off the axis since it can mess up small changes and make them look large
* Misleading use of a dual y-axis - Just be careful with this
* Artificially limiting the scope of the data - Just include the data
* Problematic choices in how data is grouped - Be careful
* Using part-to-whole visuals when the total do not sum up appropriately - Just make sure things like pie charts add up to 100%
* Artificially smothing trends - keep the data points when doing trendlines (for the most part)
