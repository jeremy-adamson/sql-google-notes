# Visualizing data

The Graphic representation of data or information

## Communicating your data insights

Four parts to combine for visualization and presentation [here](https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/what-makes-a-good-data-visualization/)

* Information (data) - Integrity, accuracy, consistentcy, honesty
  * The data you are working with
* Story (concept) - Interestingness (really?), relevant, meaningful, new
  * A clear and compelling narrative or concept
* Goal (function) - Usefulness, useable, fitting, efficient
  * A specific objective or function for the visual
* Visual form (metaphor) - Beauty, structure, appearance, harmony

Another way of looking at this [here](https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/junk-charts-trifecta-checkup-the-definitive-guide.html):

* What is the practical question?
* What does the data say?
* What does the visual say?

Pre-attentive attributes: marks and channels:

* Marks - basic visual objects like points, lines, and shapes.
  * Position - Where a specific mark is in space in relation to a scale or to other marks
  * Size - How big, small, long, or tall a mark is
  * Shape - Whether a specific object is given a shape that communicates something about it
  * Color - I mean... color

* Channels - are visual aspects or variables that represent charactistics of the data.  Basically marks that have been used to make things look pretty.
  * Accuracy - Are the channels helpful in accurately estimating the values being represented?
  * Popout - How easy is it to distinguish certain values form other?
  * Grouping - How good is a channel at communicating groups that exist in the data?

Design principles:

* Choose the right visual
* Optimize the data-ink ratio - Minimize visuals/graphics that aren't needed
* Use orientation effectively - Make sure labels on the chars are easy to read via the orientation
* Color - Is color...
* Numbers of things - Think about how many elements you include in any visual.  If doing lines do five or fewer.  Otherwise highlight the important ones if needed.  Pie charts should be less than seven.

Avoid misleading charts

* Don't cut off the axis since it can mess up small changes and make them look large
* Misleading use of a dual y-axis - Just be careful with this
* Artificially limiting the scope of the data - Just include the data
* Problematic choices in how data is grouped - Be careful
* Using part-to-whole visuals when the total do not sum up appropriately - Just make sure things like pie charts add up to 100%
* Artificially smothing trends - keep the data points when doing trendlines (for the most part)

## Understand data visualization

### Graphs

* Bar graphs - Size contrast or compare two or more values.  Yep, know these.
* Line graphs - Helps audience understand shifts or changes in data
* Pie charts - How much each part of something makes up the whole.
* Maps - Organize things geographically

[Types of charts/graphs](https://datavizcatalogue.com/#google_vignette)

Think of where you want your audience to focus

Histogram - A chart that shows how often data calues fall in to certain ranges
Correlation charts - Show how values can be related to each other

Static and Dynamic visualizations

* In dynamic ones the users have some control over what they see
* Tableau - A business intelligence and alaytics plaform that helps people see, understand, and make decisions with data

When to use certain charts [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C07k0euBpr8):

* Change - If something changes over time, probably a line or column chart
* Clustering - If there is a collection of data points with similar or different values, show it through a distribution graph
* Relativity - If things are in proportion to another thing, try a pie chart
* Ranking - Position in a scale of achievement or status, try a column chart
* Correlation - If you want to show a correlation between two things, try a scatter plot.

## Design data visualizations

The elements of art:

* Line
* Shape
* Color
  * Hue
  * Intensity - How bright or dull it is
  * Value - Black or white added
* Space
* Movement

Nine basic priciples of design:

* Balance - Is it balanced around stuff like color and shape
* Emphasis - Is there a focal point where you want the audience to look
* Movement - The path that the observer's eye will travel
* Pattern - Does stuff kinda have a visual pattern?
* Repetition
* Proportion - Mostly for pie charts
* Rhythm - Beats me
* Variety - Throw in some stuff so it doesn't all look the same
* Unity - Is there a flow or point to it all that can be seen

THE WHOLE POINT IS TO MAKE IT EASY FOR PEOPLE TO SEE THE CONCLUSION

Data composition - Combining the individual parts in a visualization and displaying them together as a whole

Elements for effective visuals (five second rule)

* Clear meaning
* Sophisticated use of contrast
* Refined execution

Design thinking - A process used to solve complex problems in a user-centric way

Five phases of the design process:

* Empathize - Think about the emotions and needs of your target audience
* Define - Helps define actual problems from the visualizations
* Ideate - Start to generate your data viz ideas (brainstorm)
* Prototype - Do a rough draft and see how it is
* Test - Show them for a peer review

## Explore visualization considerations

* Headlines - At the top of the visualization communicating what data is being presented.  An attention grabbing title.
  * Length: The width of the data frame
  * Position: Above the data
  * Don't:
    * Use all caps
    * Use italics
    * Use acronyms
    * Use humor
* Subtitle - Gives a little bit of context to the headline
  * Length: Shorter than the headline
  * Position: Right below the headline
  * Don't:
    * Use undefined words
    * Use all caps, bold, or italic
    * Use acronyms or abbreviations
* Labels - Things that identify what is being measured in a meaningful way
  * Length: Usually fewer than 30 characters
  * Position: Next to data or below or beside axes
  * Additional:
    * Use a few words only
    * Use thoughtful color-coding
    * Use callouts to point to the data
* Annotation - Little blips that help focus the audience towards particular spots or data points
  * Length: Varies, limited by open space
  * Position: Immediately next to data annotated
  * Don't:
    * Use all caps, bold, or italic
    * Use rotated text
    * Distract from the data itself

### Accessible visualizations

Ways to make data visualizations accessible:

* Labeling - Don't rely too much on legends
* Text alternatives - provides additional context
* Text-based format
* Distiguishing - Color choices or making things stand out in various ways
* Simplify - Don't make it too cluttered
