# Spreadsheets

Revisting the phases of the data life cycle when it comes to spreadsheets

* Plan
  * Mostly what kind of formatting will be used
* Capture
  * Connecting or filling in the data hopefully with an automated process
* Manage
  * How it will be organized, filtered, and updated and by whom
* Analyze
  * What formulas will be used and simple images/graphics
* Archive
  * Storing it?
* Destroy
  * How it's disposed of when the time comes if it needs to be

## Quirky things to remember for later

### Absolute Referencing

* Use $ before each locator tag (both row and column) when copying a formula so that it will always reference that particular location no matter where it's moved or copied to

### Combining with functions

* Some commands are both formulas and functions such at COUNTIF()

## Helpful tips

* Filter data to make things less busy when possible
* Use freeze and unfreeze headers
* Create a tab with just the raw data and a sparate tab with just the data that you need
* Using the F4 key for absolute and mixed references as a shortcut

## Conditional Formatting

Conditional formatting can be used to highligh cells in a different color based on their content

* ISERROR

## Functions

* Stuff like =SUM and whatnot
* Different from a formula since a formula is a set of instructions while function is a preset command

## Structured thinking

The process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportuniities, and identifying the options

* Problem Domain - The specific area of analysis that encompasses every activity affecting or affected by the problem

* Scope of work (SOW) - An agreed-upon outline of the work you're going to perform on a project
  * Deliverables - items or tasks you will complete before you can finish the project
    * Goals for the employee training event
    * Estimated budget
    * List of employees to invite
  * Timeline - include due dates for when deliverables, milestones, and or reports are due
    * Specific dates
  * Milestones - are significant tasks you will confirm along your timeline to help everyone know the project is on track
    * Confirm Budget
    * Confirm list of employees who will attend
    * Confirm trainers
  * Reports - notify everyone as you finalize deliverables and meet milestones
    * Final list of emplyeers who attended
    * Feedback

## Context

The condition in which something exists or happens.  The who, what, where, when, why, how of the information.
