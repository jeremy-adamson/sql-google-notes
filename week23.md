* Plan
  * Mostly what kind of formatting will be used
* Capture
  * Connecting or filling in the data hopefully with an automated process
* Manage
  * How it will be organized, filtered, and updated and by whom
* Analyze
  * What formulas will be used and simple images/graphics
* Archive
  * Storing it?
* Destroy
  * How it's disposed of when the time comes if it needs to be
