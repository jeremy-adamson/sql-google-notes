# Spreadsheets

Revisting the phases of the data life cycle when it comes to spreadsheets

* Plan
  * Mostly what kind of formatting will be used
* Capture
  * Connecting or filling in the data hopefully with an automated process
* Manage
  * How it will be organized, filtered, and updated and by whom
* Analyze
  * What formulas will be used and simple images/graphics
* Archive
  * Storing it?
* Destroy
  * How it's disposed of when the time comes if it needs to be

## Quirky things to remember for later

### Absolute Referencing

* Use $ before each locator tag (both row and column) when copying a formula so that it will always reference that particular location no matter where it's moved or copied to

### Combining with functions

* Some commands are both formulas and functions such at COUNTIF()

## Helpful tips

* Filter data to make things less busy when possible
* Use freeze and unfreeze headers
* Create a tab with just the raw data and a sparate tab with just the data that you need
* Using the F4 key for absolute and mixed references as a shortcut

## Conditional Formatting

Conditional formatting can be used to highligh cells in a different color based on their content

* ISERROR

## Functions

* Stuff like =SUM and whatnot
* Different from a formula since a formula is a set of instructions while function is a preset command
