# Developing presentation and slideshows

## The art and sceince of an effective presentation

Framework starts with your understanding of the business task

Overall method of introducting graphs/information

* Introduce the graphic by name
* Answer obvious questions before they're asked
  * When, where, and how the data was procured
* State the insight of your graphic
* Call otu data to support that insight
* Tell your audience why it matters

Does this data point or chart push the point that I want people to walk away with

### Messy vs. Good example of a presentation

Messy:

* Avoid lengthy titles
* Data appears quite boring with a large amount of text and multiple graphics
* Who you are, why they're there are not highlighted and people will be trying to decipher the slide itself
* You want people to build familiarity with the data and have an overall story
* Final conclusion has too much text and there really isn't a flow to it all that leads people to the conclusion

Overall, no story or logical flow from data to conclusion. No titles on most slides. Too much text and difficult to understand and the format was inconsistent with no theme.  No recommendation at the end which was highlighted.

Good Example:

* Title slide
  * Simple two word title
  * Stated presenter
  * "Last Updated" included
* Table of contents slide restating the title
  * Purpose statement (What are we talking about?)
  * Rell your story (with data)
  * Conclusion
  * Appendix
* Objective or purpose (What are we talking about?)
* Data
  * Introduce the visual first with what the data on the graphic (ehhh)
  * By not including text it focuses attention towards the graphic (ehhh)
  * Use text in a short and concise manner
  * Now introduce text with specific points
  * Title should be just for the data being covered
  * Highlight findings and simplify the terms
* Big conclusions
  * Flat out state the things

## Identify presentation skills and practices

Two key responsibilities as a data analyst:

* Analyze the data
* Present the findings

Presentation tips:

* Chennel your excitement
* Start with the broader ideas
* Use the five second rule
  * Wait five seconds after showing a data visualization
  * Ask if they understand
  * Give your audience another five seconds
  * Tell them the conclusion that they are to understand
* Preparation is key

Additional tips:

* Know your flow - Have the general flow of the presentation worked out
  * Who is my audience
    * If the audience is comprised of executives, board members, directors, etc. then everything should be kept at a hight level since they will want the insights but not really the whole story.
    * If the audience is stakeholders and managers, be prepared with talking points about some of the details in your analysis which led to the final conclusions
    * If it's other analysts then go into the details of the data, processes, and results
  * What is the purpose of my presentation
    * If the goal is to request or recommend something like a sales pitch, have each slide work towards the recommendations
    * If the goal is purely on the results of the analysis, lead to the results
    * If the goal is to privide a report on the data analysis, summarize the data and key findings to let the data speak for itself
* Prepare talking points and limit text on slides
  * Audience should not take more than give seconds reading any block of text
* End with recommendations
  * Use one slide for recommendations at the end (or results)
  * If something is to be done, describe what you would consider a successful outcome.
* Allow enough time for the presentation and questions
  * Be aware of your timing
  * Present data efficiently
  * Either wait until the end or allow for questions at the end of each slide

* First slide: Agenda
  * Provide a bulleted list of topics to be covered (table of contents) with the time to be spent on each
* Second slide: Purpose
  * What is the aim or goal of the project itself
* Third slide: Data/analysis
  * Each slide should introduce the slide that follows it
  * For extra visuals, fade in one bullet point at a time, only display the visual that is relavant to what you are talking about (fade out stuff not being talked about), use arrows or callouts to what is currently being used
* Fourth slide: Recommendations
* Fifth slide: call to action

All of this is outlined [here](https://d18ky98rnyall9.cloudfront.net/_LwuiIoNSYq8LoiKDUmKxw_e8ff903b66b943ddaea3b8517fe8a3af_Sharing-your-data-findings-in-presentations-_-Tips-and-Tricks.pdf?Expires=1661385600&Signature=SRyOKmenlcTQXAapOJRN6YSU02q9vgkW99sBbbDTri6YTHWTnkRtuWmvURqIHQI4M4AnwsDY5OKfbmPpE263L7sqnryN7K9KeBTCLhjunaotawAF4cCtxsn1ITCiff6YHqDY2mzdpZmiSei5cp7jzupOx1WIeObCRT35QYcFPFs_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A)

Your audience:

* Will not always follow the steps to get to the conclusions
* Audience has other things on their mind
* Can get easily distracted

## Caveats and limitations to data

Anticipate questions:

* Understanding stakeholder expectations will give an idea of what questions will be asked
* Make sure you have a clear understanding of the objective and what the stakeholders wanted

Start with zero assumptions on the audience's understanding on the specific terms

### Handling objections - Can be about the data, analysis, or findings

* For data - Could be in appendix
  * Where you got the data
  * What systems it came from
  * What tranformations happened to it
  * How fresh and accurate is the data
* For the analysis - Document the steps
  * Is it reproducable
  * Who did you give feedback from
* Findings
  * Do these findings exist in previous time periods?
  * Did you control for the difference in your data?

Responding to possible objections

* Communicate assumptions made
* Explain why your analysis might be different than expected
* Acknowledge that those onbjections are valid and take steps to investigate it further

## Listen, respond, and include

Appendix - Not really needed as part of the presentation itelf but more of a reference for the audience if questions go a little deeper than a typical presentation would allow for
