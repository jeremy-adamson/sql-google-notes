# SQL Google Certificate

8/10/22 - 9/1/22

## About the Course

Class notes from the SQL Google certificate course on Coursera.  SQL is a powerful tool in data analytics and took it upon myself to learn about the language during the break between my Javascript and Python courses.  In addition, documenting notes in this manner serves to have a project to practice the skills learned in Code Fellows 102.
