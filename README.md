# SQL Google Certificate

## About the Course

Class notes from the SQL Google certificate course on Coursera.  I thought that I'd get into SQL since I have a break between my Javascript and Python classes and will keep my reading notes here.  Also to have a side project to practice the skills learned in Code Fellows 102.
