# Effectively organizing data

## Best practices when organizing data

* Naming conventions
* Foldering
* Archiving older files
* Align your naming and storage practes with your team
* Develop metadata practices

Think about how often copies are being made of the same thing and stored in multiple places

## Common formats

* YYYMMDD for dates
* v## for versions
* Work out conventions early
* Make sure everyone is one the same page
* Keep names short
* Have a small text file to keep the naming conventions

## Data security vs. access to data

* Encryption uses a unique alorithm to alter data and make it unusable bu useres and applications that don't know the algorithm
* Tokenization replaces the data elements you want tot protect with randmly generated data referred to as a token.  The original data is stored in a separate location and is mapped to the tokens.
