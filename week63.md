# Crafting Data Stories

## Use data to develop stories

Dashboard - a tool that organizes information from multiple datasets into one central location for tracking, analysis, and simple visualization

Dashboard filter - A tool for showing only the data that meets a specific criteria while hiding the rest

Data storytelling - Communicating the meaning of a dataset with visuals and a narrative that are cutomized for each particular audience

Sata storytelling steps:

* Engage your audience
  * What role does this audience play?
  * What is their stake in the project?
  * What do they hope to get from the data insights I deliver?
* Create compelling visuals
  * Incorporate some interactive layerd data so the curious can explore
  * Highlight the meaning behind the numbers at a clance
  * Visuals should be clear and able to stand on their own
* Tell the story in an interesting narrative
  * Clearly articulate recurring themes and data points
  * Provide recommendations at the end
  * Choose a primary message/spotlight

Spotlighting - scanning through data to quickly identify the most important insights

## Use Tableau dashboards

Can do either live or static dashboards/insights

* How old is the data?
* How long until the insights are stale or not longer valid to make decisions?
* Does this data or analysis need updating on a regular basis to remain valuable?

## Sharing data stories

Five main things to keep in mind for a narrative:

* Characters - Clients, stakeholders, customers, etc.
* Setting - What's going on, how often, what tasks are going on
* Plot - conflict/tension (compeditor or issue to be fixed)
* Big reveal - How the data shows how to solve the problem
* Aha moment - Share the reccomendations and why the thing will work

Stuff to keep in mind:

* Theme
* Title/subtitle
* What's the single most important thing per slide
* Link to the visual from the slideshow instead of just copy/paste so that slideshow will always be up to date (not just embed)
